Predicting a falling balloon’s impact point requires a mix of **balloon-specific parameters** (e.g., weight, shape, drag) and **atmospheric/terrain variables** (especially wind data at various altitudes). Below is a comprehensive list of variables typically needed:

---

## 1. Balloon & Descent Parameters

1. **Balloon Weight (Total Mass) / Payload Weight**  
   - The overall mass (including any payload) determines how quickly it will descend under gravity.

2. **Balloon Geometry and Drag Coefficient**  
   - The cross-sectional area and shape of the balloon (plus any attached payload) affect how air resistance (drag) acts on the balloon.

3. **Descent Rate / Vertical Velocity Profile**  
   - If you have an estimated or measured rate at which the balloon falls, you can combine this with horizontal wind data to track its path.

4. **Initial Conditions**  
   - The latitude, longitude, and altitude where the balloon starts to descend.  
   - Any initial horizontal velocity if the balloon is moving before it starts its uncontrolled descent.

## 2. Meteorological Variables

1. **Wind Speed & Wind Direction at Multiple Altitudes**  
   - **Essential** for horizontal drift. Ideally, you want data from the balloon’s altitude down to the surface at intervals (e.g., every few hundred meters or at standard pressure levels).  
   - If only discrete altitudes (10 m, 80 m, 120 m, 180 m) are available, you can interpolate between them.  

2. **Wind Gusts**  
   - Gusts can cause short, sudden lateral movements.  
   - Particularly relevant near the surface where turbulence is greater.

3. **Temperature (at Various Altitudes)**  
   - Affects air density (and thus the balloon’s buoyancy and descent rate).  
   - Large temperature gradients can indicate wind shear or unstable air.

4. **Pressure (Surface or Sea-Level Pressure + Possibly Upper-Level Pressure)**  
   - Helps contextualize larger-scale weather patterns and can be useful for more advanced trajectory models.

5. **Humidity / Dew Point**  
   - Can help identify cloud layers or potential icing (if relevant), though less critical than wind for horizontal drift.

6. **Precipitation / Weather Code**  
   - Heavy rain or storm activity can introduce updrafts/downdrafts, changing the balloon’s vertical speed or path.  
   - Thunderstorms, for example, can have strong vertical motions that alter descent.

7. **Cloud Cover (Low/Mid/High)**  
   - By itself doesn’t give direct drift info, but extensive cloud layers can accompany fronts or storms with stronger, variable winds.

8. **Visibility**  
   - More for operational/safety concerns rather than trajectory, but can correlate with fog or storm systems that have strong localized winds.

## 3. Terrain & Environmental Factors

1. **Elevation / Terrain Data**  
   - Mountains, hills, or valleys can channel winds or cause localized wind patterns (downslope winds, updrafts, etc.).  
   - Also determines the balloon’s final “ground level” altitude.

2. **Surface Roughness / Land Cover**  
   - Influences near-surface turbulence. Urban areas, forests, or open fields can have different wind profiles close to the ground.

3. **Time of Day**  
   - Influences boundary layer stability. During daytime, solar heating can cause thermals or turbulence; at night, winds and turbulence profiles can be different.

## 4. Putting It All Together

1. **Build a Wind Profile**  
   - Use wind speed/direction at various altitudes (plus gusts) to map out horizontal motion as the balloon descends.

2. **Model the Balloon’s Descent Rate**  
   - Combine the balloon’s weight, drag coefficient, and local air density (from temperature/pressure) to estimate vertical velocity.

3. **Stepwise or Continuous Trajectory Simulation**  
   - For each small step in altitude, apply the local wind vector to shift the balloon horizontally while it descends vertically.  
   - Factor in gusts or turbulent layers for more realism.

4. **Adjust for Local Terrain Effects**  
   - If the balloon passes over complex terrain, incorporate any known orographic (mountain-related) wind patterns or updrafts.

5. **Consider Uncertainties**  
   - Weather data has inherent forecast errors, and gusts/turbulence can be unpredictable.  
   - Often, you’ll end up with a “probability area” rather than a single pinpoint landing location.

### In Summary

- **Absolutely Essential**: Wind profiles (speed/direction) from descent altitude to ground, balloon weight/mass, and basic balloon shape/drag.  
- **Highly Useful**: Wind gusts, temperature, pressure, and precipitation/storm data.  
- **Contextual/Advanced**: Terrain elevation/land cover, humidity, time-of-day influences, and local updraft/downdraft patterns.

Collecting and combining these data points allows you to simulate the balloon’s fall and estimate a landing zone with reasonable accuracy.
